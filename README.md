Search Verbatim (sic)
=====================

# Overview
Search Verbatim (sic) is a browser extension which forces Google to use Verbatim searching and adds the plus ('+') sign to all search terms in DuckDuckGo. Those are the only two I use regularly enough to know the operators for; I am happy to add more search engines - message me on GitHub with details of the search engine and how to enable verbatim mode.

# Browser Support
The extension was designed in Opera and works in both Chrome and Opera desktop editions.
